## Overview

This project is a **Task Manager** application that allows users to easily organize and manage their tasks. Users can add/delete tasks, track their progress, mark tasks as complete or incomplete, and filter complete/incomplete items. Additionally, the application includes a **Contact Us** form for users to reach out for support or inquiries.

The application is designed with a clean and modern user interface, featuring responsive design principles to ensure it works across various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Javascript library for building the user interface.
- **HTML5**: Structuring the content on the web pages.

## Ideas for Future Improvement

- **Task Categorization**: Add the ability to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, etc.) for better organization.
- **Task Reminders**: Setting dates or times the task is due by, and sending reminders or notifications.
- **User Authentification**: Allow users to sign in, so their tasks are saved and accessible across devices.
- **Working Contact Page**: Have the contact form be more functional and actually have the data submit somewhere.
